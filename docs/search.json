    "text": "Physical activity is a great way for anyone of any age to take charge of their health. Regular physical activity can result in numerous health benefits – such as decreasing risk for chronic diseases and early death. Cities that are built to support physical activity not only promote health among residents, but also enrich the community by supporting economic stimulation and social connection. In practice, this could look like sidewalks, trails, or parks that are safe and convenient for people to integrate to their daily life.\nFollowing the Community Preventive Services Task Force’s built environment recommendation, the CDC recommends focusing on activity-friendly routes and everyday destinations. Some measures of activity-friendly routes include: street pattern design & connectivity, pedestrian infrastructure, bicycle infrastructure, and public transit infrastructure & access. Everyday destinations can be affected by increased proximity to community or neighborhood destinations, mixed land use, residential density, and parks parks access.\nTogether, the City of Woonsocket and advocates, including the Woonsocket HEZ & Downtown Woonsocket Collaborative, have taken measures to:\n\nMaintain flexibility in City zoning and land use policies to meet current needs as appropriate\nProvide regional bicycle connections and recreational opportunities for both residents and visitors, through paths like the Blackstone River Bikeway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlight #1\nHighlight #1\n\nHighlight #2\nHighlight #2\n\nHighlight #3\nHighlight #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here Text here\nPolicy/events that used the built environment to promote physical activity\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TB\n  subgraph Land Use\n    B[\"`&lt;b&gt;Downtown Redevelopment Area Designation&lt;/b&gt;\n    2014`\"] --&gt; C[\"`&lt;b&gt;Mixed-Use Overlay Zoning - Downtown Main Street District&lt;/b&gt;\n    2015 (expanded 2024)`\"]\n  end \n  \n  subgraph Pedestrian & Cyclist Networks\n    F(\"`&lt;b&gt;Blackstone Valley Bikeway&lt;/b&gt;\n    2007-2018`\") --&gt; A[\"`&lt;b&gt;Bikeway Signage&lt;/b&gt;\n    2014`\"]\n    A[\"`&lt;b&gt;Bikeway Signage&lt;/b&gt;\n    2014`\"] --&gt; G(\"`&lt;b&gt;Truman Drive Greenway project in the City of Woonsocket&lt;/b&gt;\n    2023-2024`\")\n    G(\"`&lt;b&gt;Truman Drive Greenway project in the City of Woonsocket&lt;/b&gt;\n    2023-2024`\") --&gt; D[\"`&lt;b&gt;Safe Streets for All&lt;/b&gt;\n    2024`\"]\n    G(\"`&lt;b&gt;Truman Drive Greenway project in the City of Woonsocket&lt;/b&gt;\n    2023-2024`\") --&gt; E[\"`&lt;b&gt;Ban of electronic bikes in City parks&lt;/b&gt;\n    2024`\"]\n  end"
